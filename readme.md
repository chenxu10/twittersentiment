# TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

## THE PROBLEM

### PUBLIC EMOTION ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

There is a heated debate on people's reaction to the booming of artificial intelligence. Some parties hold a positive attitude towards it, while other people think we should be extremely cautious on the new technology for it may be mastered by some vicious guy. In this project, I try to use twitter api data to find out the public's opinion on the AI.

## THE SOLUTION

Using python, tweepy and natural language processing package textblob, I called the Twitter API to fetch tweets, cleaned the tweets and Â trained an naive bayes classifer to conduct sentiment analyse on all tweets related to artificial intelligence.

The detailed code can bee seen here.

## CONCLUSION

I found the with a sampling of 2000 tweets, around 11.94% people hold a postive emotion on AI, 73.13% people feel negative on AI and around 15% percent people is netural about AI.

This is a little bit contradictory to the hypothesis I made according to the information I got from mass media and internet report. It seems that at least the twitter users are still conservative on the coming of AI.
